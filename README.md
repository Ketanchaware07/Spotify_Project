# Spotify_Project
This project explores clustering techniques to group Spotify songs based on their audio features. Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze data such as danceability, energy, tempo, valence, and more to uncover patterns in music. This can help users discover similar songs and generate dynamic playlists.
